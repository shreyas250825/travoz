# Tourist Safety Alert System - TODO

## Completed Tasks

1. **Updated user.js**

   - Updated the SOS alert broadcast to use the new channel name 'tourist-safety-alerts'.
   - Added location update broadcasting in the geolocation success callback.
   - Added a click event listener to the SOS button for easy testing (temporary).
   - Added debugging console.log in `triggerSOS` function.

2. **Updated admin.js**
   - Changed BroadcastChannel name to 'tourist-safety-alerts'.
   - Updated message handler to process both 'SOS_ALERT' and 'LOCATION_UPDATE' messages.
   - Added `handleLocationUpdate` function to move the user marker on the map for location updates.
   - Added `handleStorageChange` function for localStorage fallback.
   - Added storage event listener for fallback.
   - Added debugging console.log in `handleNewAlert` function and message handler.
   - Fixed JavaScript error in `updateChart` function by adding guard for `window.analyticsChart.draw`.

3. **Enhanced admin.css**
   - Added comprehensive CSS styles for the new notifications section.
   - Added styles for the blockchain verification section.
   - Added animations for notification alerts and verification ticks.
   - Added responsive design elements for better mobile compatibility.
   - Added hover effects and transitions for better user experience.

4. **Enhanced admin.js**
   - Added `initializeNotifications()` function to create and manage the notifications system.
   - Added `initializeVerification()` function to create and manage the blockchain verification system.
   - Updated DOMContentLoaded event listener to initialize both new systems.
   - Integrated notifications and verification into the existing dashboard structure.

5. **Made Header Sticky**
   - Added `position: sticky` and `top: 0` to the header CSS for persistent visibility.
   - Increased z-index to 1000 to ensure header stays above all content.
   - Header now remains visible when scrolling through dashboard content.

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Test the System**
   - Open user.html and admin.html in different browser tabs or windows.
   - Login to user.html with any details (e.g., Name: Test User, ID: 123456, KYC: ABC123, Contact: 9876543210).
   - Login to admin.html (Officer ID: admin, Password: password).
   - In user.html, go to Emergency tab and click the SOS button (now triggers immediately for testing).
   - Check admin.html - new alert should appear instantly with sound, map marker, table update, and notification.
   - Move the user's location and verify the marker updates on the admin map.
   - Test fallback mechanisms if BroadcastChannel is not supported.

2. **Enhance UI/UX**
   - Add visual indicators for location updates on the admin dashboard.
   - Improve error handling for geolocation failures.
   - Add more detailed logging for debugging.

3. **Security and Performance**
   - Implement proper authentication for admin login.
   - Optimize map rendering for multiple markers.
   - Add rate limiting for location updates to prevent excessive broadcasts.

4. **Additional Features**
   - Add user profile management.
   - Implement real-time chat between user and admin.
   - Add push notifications for mobile devices.

## Notes

- The system uses BroadcastChannel for real-time communication between user and admin interfaces.
- Fallback to localStorage polling is implemented for browsers that don't support BroadcastChannel.
- Location updates are sent every 30 seconds when geolocation is available.
- The admin dashboard displays SOS alerts on a map, in a table, and as notifications.
- Temporary click event added to SOS button for easy testing - remove after testing.
- Fixed JavaScript error in admin.js for analytics chart.
